# prompt: Your .editorconfig file looks well-structured and covers common project needs. Here’s a quick review with a few “perks” (enhancements or tips):
# ⸻
# What You’re Doing Well (Baseline Best Practices):
# 	•	root = true: Ensures this is the root .editorconfig and prevents cascading from parent directories—great for consistency.
# 	•	LF line endings: Standardizes line endings across OSs—important for team collaboration.
# 	•	UTF-8 charset: Essential for modern web development.
# 	•	Final newline enforcement: Helps avoid diffs on added lines and complies with POSIX expectations.
# ⸻
# Enhancement Perks:
# 1. Add Markdown & HTML support
# If your repo includes documentation or static content:
# [*.{md,html}]
# charset = utf-8
# indent_style = space
# indent_size = 2
# insert_final_newline = true
# 2. Tighten Up Shell Script Formatting
# If using shell scripts:
# [*.sh]
# charset = utf-8
# indent_style = space
# indent_size = 4
# insert_final_newline = true
# 3. Make JSON stricter
# Some teams prefer 2-space indents for JSON to match common formatting:
# [*.json]
# indent_size = 2
# Or apply it selectively:
# [{*.test.json,*.config.json}]
# indent_size = 2
# 4. YAML Alignment
# YAML often reads better with 2 spaces:
# [*.{yml,yaml}]
# indent_size = 2
# 5. Auto-Detection Safety Perk
# If you have varied styles in subdirectories and want to explicitly define overrides, consider scoped rules like:
# [frontend/**.ts]
# indent_size = 2
# ⸻
# Would you like a project-specific .editorconfig tailored to your frontend/backend structure (e.g., React + Node + Docs + Tests)? I can generate that.

# Assuming 'data' and 'graph' are defined from the previous code

# Step 3: Analyze and visualize the graph (example: Venn diagram)
known_words = set(data["words"].keys())
generated_words = set(node for node, attr in graph.nodes(data=True) if attr.get("category") == "Generated")

venn2([known_words, generated_words], ('Known Words', 'Generated Words'))
plt.title("Known vs. Generated Words")
plt.show()
