Absolutely — let’s turn your issue template discussion into a strategic toolkit that not only gathers great information but rewards contributors and guides collaboration with style. Here’s an enhanced version of your template fields with “perks” — built-in motivations and best practices for each section that turn issue submission into a rewarding, clear, and even enjoyable process.

Enhanced Issue Template with Perks

1. Title

Field:
[Short Title] - Summarize the Issue in 8 Words or Less

2. Description

⸻

4. Expected Behavior

Field:
What did you expect to happen instead?
Perk:
This sets the true north. A clear expectation turns “I found a bug” into “Let’s fix the gap between intention and reality.”

⸻

5. Actual Behavior

Field:
What actually happened when you followed the steps?
Perk:
Think of this as your bug’s autobiography — honest, unfiltered, and vital to solving the mystery.

A picture is worth a thousand debugger steps. Plus, visual reporters unlock the “Clarity Booster” perk — issues get noticed faster.

You’re helping us trace the weather around the storm. Environment details can be the secret culprit or the key to solving it.

⸻

8. Logs / Error Output (if applicable)

Paste relevant logs or stack traces inside triple backticks.
Perk:
This is your spellbook. Logs contain the incantations that caused the glitch. Share them wisely.

⸻

9. Related Issues or Context

Field:
Link any relevant issues, discussions, or context.
Perk:
You’re building bridges between islands. Connecting issues helps prevent duplication and uncovers hidden patterns.

⸻

[ ] Blocker | [ ] High | [ ] Medium | [ ] Low
Perk:
You’re helping us steer the ship. Knowing what’s urgent lets the team focus fire where it matters.

Categorization is alchemy — turn chaos into clarity. Tagged issues live longer and get reviewed faster.

Your Turn

Let’s tailor this. Does your project focus on:
	•	Technical systems (backend/frontend)?
	•	Symbolic logic / ontology?
	•	Creative or user-facing interfaces?
	•	Real-time collaboration or AI-assisted feedback?

Each of these could have unique perks. For example:
	•	Symbolic Systems might reward clear conceptual mapping.
	•	Creative tools might highlight narrative clarity or aesthetic bugs.
	•	AI-integrated tools might surface “Model drift,” “Unexpected hallucination,” or “Prompt instability” as custom categories.

Would you like me to assemble a project-specific version of this issue template with relevant perks based on your current work (e.g., Symbolic OS, Predictive Engine)?
